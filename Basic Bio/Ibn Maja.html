    Ibn Majah set out on his journey in 230 AH (844 CE) at the age of 22 to learn Hadith from scholars. He traveled to Khurasan, Basra, Kufah, Baghdad, Damascus, Makkah, Madinah, and Egypt. 
    He was instructed by a number of highly knowledgeable scholars, such as Ibrahim ibn Al-Mundhir, Al-Hafiz Al-Halawani Abu Muhammad Hassan ibn `Ali ibn Muhammad Al-Khallal, Al-Hafiz Az-Zubair ibn Bitar, Salamah ibn Shabib, Al-Hafiz Ya`qoub ibn Hamid, Isma`il ibn Mousa Al-Fazari, Harmalah ibn Yahya, and Zuhair ibn Harb. After an arduous journey that lasted more than 15 years, Ibn Majah turned back to Qazween and settled in it. He spent most of his time writing, classifying, and narrating hadiths. At that time, his fame grew far and wide and seekers of knowledge from everywhere would come to him.
    He studied under Imam Malik and others, and many people narrated Hadeeth from him. 
    He was one of the eminent scholars of Hadeeth,but his Sunan contains many weak and even Munkar Hadeeth. 
    Ibn Majah died in Ramadan in 273H. 
    Sunan Ibn Majah has been translated to English, and printed by Kazi Publications, Lahore.
