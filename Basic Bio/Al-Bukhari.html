        Hadeeth which he selected from the thousands of Hadeeth that he had memorized. Al-Bukhari studied under famous Hadeeth Imam like
        Imams like Malik bin Anas and Yahya bin Ma'im. He studied in Samarqaed, the present day capital
        of Uzbekistan. Nowadays, the capital is Tashkent, the night of Eid-ul-Fitr, 256AH. Al-Bukhari was unique in the science of methodology of Hadeeth and his book SAl-Jami'As-Sahih is 
        considered to be the most authentic book after the Qur'an. Saheeh Bukhari has been translated to English and is easily available.
